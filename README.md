Time series data is everywhere! Working with them is an important part of Data Science.
# Description:  
Did you know that avocados can teach you about time series and what they do? To understand how this is possible, just show up for the event!
It is likely that you often encounter graphs of time series analysis. Time series graphs are one of the most common ways data is visualized. There are two major aspects to time series we will cover here. Time series analysis and time series forecasting. If you think predicting the future is a pretty neat super-power, then you’ll want to learn about some modern software techniques that make this possible. This workshop is a perfect gateway for gaining new fundamental perspectives about times series data. Getting a glimpse at what is possible with modern techniques opens the door for you to better understand your world with data. If this sounds like an essential skill, that’s because it is. Python has great data science tools for working with time series. We’ll walk through some of the basics to get your learning journey started.
### Target Audience:  
This live online workshop has been designed with the beginner in mind. All levels welcome! If you have learned some Python in our Intro To Python or Intro To Panda’s events, it will be even easier to follow the time series coding walkthrough. Knowing some Python will help, but is not required.  
### What You Will Learn:  
What is a time series?  
Where does time series data come from?  
What are some practical applications derived from time series data?  
Types of forecasting  
Investigating an example time series dataset (this may involve avocados)  
How to visualize a time series  
Running a time series forecast
